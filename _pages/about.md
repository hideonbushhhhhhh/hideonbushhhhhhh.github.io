I am a third-year master student at Zhejiang University, and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhongjie Ba](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dO2kc6kAAAAJ) and [Kui Ren](). Prior to attending ZJU, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University City College (Hangzhou City University). My current research interests are focused on developing general-purpose models for perception and control.



[//]: # (My particular interest lies in designing for sequential decision-making, utilizing unified approaches to learn from diverse and/or unlabeled sequential data, and boarder logistic and applications with large foundation models.)
