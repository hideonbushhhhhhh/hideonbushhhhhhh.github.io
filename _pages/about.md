 I am a second year master at Zhejiang University. I am glad to advised by Prof. [Zhongjie Ba](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dO2kc6kAAAAJ), Before ZJU, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University City College(Hangzhou City University).

My current research interest focused on developing general-purpose model models for perception and control.
My particular interest lies in designing for sequential decision-making, utilizing unified approaches to learn from diverse and/or unlabeled sequential data, and boarder logistic and applications with large foundation models.
